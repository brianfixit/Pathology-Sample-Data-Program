              <ol>
              <li><h4>Data is loaded using Yahoo Query Language to get the body element of the page hosting the sample data.</h4></li>
              <li><h4>The YQL query returns an XML object which is parsed to retrieve our sample data.</h4> </li>
              <li><h4>The resulting string is processed so the fields are given in standard JSON format to avoid parse errors.</h4></li>
              <li><h4>Problem data is normalized ( so the file would parse cleanly )</h4></li>
              <ul><li><h5>There were three records for which the age field was omitted, these values were replaced with zero's</h5></li>
                  <li><h5>The entire result string was processed to insert the requisite quotation marks so that all data was of the form "key":value</h5></li>
                  <li><h5>I used JSONLint to verify the structure of the result string and it indicated the error.</h5></li>
                   <li><h5>An array identifier and a trailing ] are added so the string matches the formatting of a JSON Array</h5></li>
                    <li><h5>The JSON Array is stored in a variable and used for iteration to harvest the required data to arrays</h5></li>
                              
              </ul>
              <li><h4>The result set is traversed with a for loop and each individual record is inspected</h4></li>
              <li><h4>As the data is processed, functions are called to capture the total medals by country, total bronze medals by sport and lastly the medals for athletes between 22 and 29</h4></li>

              <li>The D3 code in the page is bound to the appropriate array and the enter() method creates the objects associated with the data set</li>
